      Hello Everyone,
      I am Manasvi and you can call me as Manu or Minu. I'm originally from Gujarat, in the north of India. I earned a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from my home country, and following graduation, I gained expertise in two different fields: digital marketing and web development. I then moved to Canada to do my postgraduate diploma degree in Digital Design + Web Development, specialising in web stream. I'm in my third semester right now. I also work as a guest services agent full-time at the Holiday Inn Hotel.
